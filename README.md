# 📸 Face Recognition Attendance System using GSM and Arduino 📱

This project is a real-time face recognition-based attendance system using Python and OpenCV. It logs attendance in a CSV file and sends an SMS notification via GSM using an Arduino.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Face recognition using OpenCV and the `face_recognition` library.
- Logs attendance in `attendance.csv` with a timestamp.
- Sends SMS notification to a phone number using GSM module (SIM800L/SIM900A).
- Real-time camera feed with recognition and attendance marking.
- Serial communication between Python and Arduino.
